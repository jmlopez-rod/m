# M flow

The `m-flow` is a simplified version of the [`git-flow`][git-flow]. It follows
the same branching model except that it gets rid of the `develop` branch. This
flow is intended for projects that produce libraries that need to be versioned.

## Use case

The next sections will show how set up and use the `m-flow`. To follow along use
the [example-library] template, which is a basic node library that provides one
function.

From here on we will work with the [example-lib-m-flow] repository.

## Setup

Run `m init` to create missing files and/or update existing ones.

<SvgImage href={initSvgUrl} />

The `package.json` file should be made to look similar to the following

```json
{
  "name": "@jmlopez-rod/example-lib-m-flow",
  "version": "0.0.0-PLACEHOLDER",
  "repository": "https://github.com/jmlopez-rod/example-lib-m-flow",
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public",
    "registry": "https://npm.pkg.github.com/"
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace the scope `@jmlopez-rod` as well as the repository field.

:::note

The version field is set to `0.0.0-PLACEHOLDER` so that we may substitute the
value before we publish the package.

:::

At this point we may commit the changes and move on to create the scripts to fun
local builds.

## Scripts

Create the following bash script. For the sake of breverity it has been called
`m/publish.sh` and it contains all the steps needed to "build" locally.

```bash title="m/publish.sh"
#!/bin/bash
set -xeuo pipefail

# source the m environment
m ci env m > /dev/null
source m/.m/env.list
export $(cut -d= -f1 m/.m/env.list)

# build directory
target=.stage

# start with a clean build directory
rm -rf "$target"
mkdir -p "$target"

# move files to the stage directory
cp -a ./src/. "$target"/
cp package.json "$target"/package.json

# Set the version
sed -i -e "s/0.0.0-PLACEHOLDER/$M_TAG/g" "./$target/package.json"

# create package
(
    cd "$target" && npm pack
)

# Only publish with the CI tool
[ "$M_CI" == "True" ] || exit 0

# Only publishing to github on every pr and master branch
npmTag=$(m ci npm_tag "$M_TAG")
npm publish "$target"/*.tgz --tag "$npmTag"

# Only on release
[ "$M_IS_RELEASE" == "True" ] || exit 0
m github release --owner "$M_OWNER" --repo "$M_REPO" --version "$M_TAG"
```

Note how the script contains commands to publish the library as well a command
to create a release. These commands will only be executed when running in
Github.

Add `.stage` to the `.gitignore` file and add the following `Makefile`.

```makefile
ciChecks:
	./m/publish.sh
```

Before we can run the script we need to make sure it has proper permissions with
`chmod +x m/publish.sh`. Now we are ready to run `make ciChecks`.

<SvgImage href={ciChecksSvgUrl} />

:::tip

This type of script is important because we get a chance to inspect all the
files that get bundled into the package. By creating an empty `.stage` directory
we get control over what files go into the packages instead of having to add
files to the `.npmignore` file. This is particular useful with typescript
projects in which we need to compile files.

## Github actions

Before proceeding creating the workflow it is recommended to work in another
branch. This will help us make sure that pull requests builds are working.

The branch name can be `topic/workflow-setup`. At this point create the
following two files.

```properties title=".npmrc"
@jmlopez-rod:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

```yaml title=".github/workflows/builder.yaml"
name: Build

on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    permissions:
      contents: write
      packages: write
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkoug
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: M environment
        run: pip install jmlopez-m
      - name: Publish
        run: ./m/publish.sh
```

Note that on the `.npmrc` file we need to use your username or the name of the
organization. Commit the files and open up a pull request.

Before you can use the new package you will need change its visibility settings.
In the Github repository website click on the package name and find its
settings. Once in there change the `package visibility`. It may start private.
If you are in an organization set it to `internal` otherwise `public`.

The goal of `m` is always provide a unique version to publish for every pull
request and branches. If the pull request was successful we should now be able
to install the package in another project.

```bash
npm install @jmlopez-rod/example-lib-m-flow@pr2
```

The above command should be adjusted to use the pr number that was used to
generate the build. At this point the pull request should be merged so that we
may start creating the builds in the `master` branch.
