  "title": "Reduce exceptions",
  "body": "Clean up a couple of exceptions that were being thrown repeatedly during initial project load of a large project on Linux:\r\n\r\n1) `matchFiles` shouldn't call `visitDirectory` on `basePaths` that don't exist (throwing from `realpath` and `readdir`)\r\n2) Once the system runs out of file watchers, stop trying to add them - just default to polling (could be a small perf win)\r\n\r\nAfter this change, \"All Exceptions\" causes the debugger to stop exactly twice: when `typescript-etw` is found to be absent and the first time the file watcher limit is hit.\r\n\r\nThis change is purely to make it easier to enable \"All Exceptions\" when debugging TypeScript - not for correctness or (significant) perf improvements.",
