  Clean up a couple of exceptions that were being thrown repeatedly during initial project load of a large project on Linux:

  1) `matchFiles` shouldn't call `visitDirectory` on `basePaths` that don't exist (throwing from `realpath` and `readdir`)
  2) Once the system runs out of file watchers, stop trying to add them - just default to polling (could be a small perf win)

  After this change, "All Exceptions" causes the debugger to stop exactly twice: when `typescript-etw` is found to be absent and the first time the file watcher limit is hit.

  This change is purely to make it easier to enable "All Exceptions" when debugging TypeScript - not for correctness or (significant) perf improvements.
